# system-design-labs
Lab for studying software design and architecture techniques, with a focus on profiling fundamental building blocks.

## Study:

1. **Read the Code**: Many are open-source (Linux, Redis, SQLite).
2. **Paper Trail**: Study foundational papers (e.g., Dynamo, MapReduce).
3. **Rebuild Mini-Versions**: Implement:
    - A tiny OS scheduler
    - A key-value store
    - A toy compiler
4. **Compare**: e.g., Kafka vs. RabbitMQ, Redis vs. Memcached.
