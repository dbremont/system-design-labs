> The Apache Tikaâ„¢ toolkit detects and extracts metadata and text from over a thousand different file types (such as PPT, XLS, and PDF). All of  these file types can be parsed through a single interface, making Tika  useful for search engine indexing, content analysis, translation, and  much more. You can find the latest release on the [download page](https://tika.apache.org/download.html). Please see the [Getting Started](https://tika.apache.org/3.0.0-BETA2/gettingstarted.html) page for more information on how to start using Tika.
