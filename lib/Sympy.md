## **Core Abstractions**

Certainly! Here's a table summarizing the main abstractions in SymPy:

| **Abstraction** | **Description** | **Example** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Basic` | Base class for all SymPy objects, providing common functionality. | - |
| `Symbol` | Represents a symbolic variable. | `x = sp.Symbol('x')` |
| `Expr` | Represents mathematical expressions, inheriting from `Basic`. | `x**2 + 2*x + 1` |
| `Function` | Represents mathematical functions. | `sp.sin(x)` |
| `Add` | Represents addition and subtraction operations. | `x + y` |
| `Mul` | Represents multiplication operations. | `x * y` |
| `Pow` | Represents exponentiation operations. | `x**2` |
| `Equation` | Represents equations, both symbolic and algebraic. | `sp.Eq(x**2 + 2*x + 1, 0)` |
| `Derivative` | Represents the derivative of a function with respect to a variable. | `sp.diff(x**2, x)` |
| `Integral` | Represents definite or indefinite integrals. | `sp.integrate(x**2, x)` |
| `Matrix` | Represents symbolic matrices and supports matrix operations. | `sp.Matrix([[1, 2], [3, 4]])` |
| `Poly` | Represents polynomials and supports polynomial arithmetic and simplification. | `sp.Poly(x**2 + 2*x + 1)` |
| `Simplify` | Functions and methods for simplifying expressions. | `sp.simplify(x**2 + 2*x + 1)` |
| `Solve` | Functions for solving equations and systems of equations symbolically. | `sp.solve(x**2 - 4, x)` |
| `Limit` | Represents the limit of an expression as a variable approaches a value. | `sp.limit(sp.sin(x)/x, x, 0)` |
| `Series` | Represents series expansions of expressions. | `sp.series(sp.sin(x), x, 0, 5)` |

## Sympy Engine

> Representation + Computation.
> 

> The **SymPy engine** is a Python library for symbolic mathematics that provides a flexible and extensible framework for performing algebraic manipulations, calculus, equation solving, and other mathematical computations symbolically and efficiently.
> 

### **Expression Tree**

> SymPy represents mathematical expressions as **expression trees**. In these trees, each node is an instance of a class representing an operation (e.g., addition, multiplication), and the leaves are the operands (constants, variables, etc.). For example, the expression $x^2 + y$  is internally represented as:`Add(Pow(Symbol('x'), Integer(2)), Symbol('y'))`
> 

### **Term Rewriting and Simplification**

> SymPy uses **term-rewriting** systems to transform mathematical expressions into simplified or **canonical forms**. It applies rules and algorithms to replace parts of expressions with equivalent but often simpler forms (e.g., simplifying trigonometric identities or factoring polynomials). It has an efficient **pattern-matching** engine to recognize and apply appropriate rules.
> 

### **Lazy Evaluation**

> SymPy uses **lazy evaluation** for performance. When an expression is created, it isn't immediately simplified. Users can control simplification by explicitly calling functions like `simplify()`, which allows SymPy to handle large and complex expressions efficiently without performing unnecessary computations.
> 

### **Code Generation**

> SymPy can generate code in other languages (e.g., C, Fortran, and Python) from symbolic expressions, enabling users to translate their symbolic computations into executable code for numerical evaluation.
> 

### **Extensibility**

> SymPy is designed to be highly extensible, allowing users to define their own symbolic objects and rules for manipulating them. The modular architecture makes it straightforward to plug in new functionality.
