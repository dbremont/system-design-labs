Elasticsearch is widely used for its powerful and versatile search capabilities. The diagram below shows the **top 6 use cases**:

ðŸ”¹ **Full-Text Search** Elasticsearch excels in full-text search scenarios due to its robust, scalable, and fast search capabilities. It allows users to perform complex queries with near real-time responses.

ðŸ”¹ **Real-Time Analytics** Elasticsearch's ability to perform analytics in real-time makes it suitable for dashboards that track live data, such as user activity, transactions, or sensor outputs.

ðŸ”¹ **Machine Learning** With the addition of the machine learning feature in X-Pack, Elasticsearch can automatically detect anomalies, patterns, and trends in the data.

ðŸ”¹ **Geo-Data Applications** Elasticsearch supports geo-data through geospatial indexing and searching capabilities. This is useful for applications that manage and visualize geographical information, such as mapping and location-based services.

ðŸ”¹ **Log and Event Data Analysis** Organizations use Elasticsearch to aggregate, monitor, and analyze logs and event data from various sources. It's a vital component of the ELK stack (**Elasticsearch**, **Logstash**, **Kibana**), and it is famous for managing system and application logs to identify issues and monitor system health.

ðŸ”¹ **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** Elasticsearch can be used as a SIEM tool, helping organizations analyze security events in real time.
