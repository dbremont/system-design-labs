| Feature | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **In-Memory Data Grid (IMDG)** | Provides a distributed in-memory data grid for storing and processing large amounts of data with fast access and low latency. |
| **Distributed SQL Queries** | Supports querying data across multiple nodes in the cluster using SQL. |
| **Data Caching** | Offers a high-performance distributed cache for storing frequently accessed data in memory, improving performance by reducing disk I/O. |
| **Compute Grid** | Allows for executing computations in parallel across the cluster. |
| **Streaming and Complex Event Processing (CEP)** | Supports real-time stream processing and complex event processing for analyzing large volumes of data in real-time. |
| **Machine Learning** | Provides support for distributed machine learning algorithms, enabling model training on large datasets in parallel. |
| **High Availability** | Includes features such as automatic failover and data replication to ensure data and computations remain available during node failures. |
| **Security** | Offers encryption, authentication, and authorization to ensure data privacy and integrity. |
| **Integration** | Integrates with various data sources and platforms including Hadoop, Spark, and Kafka. |
| **Open-Source** | Freely available for use and modification, supported by a large community of developers and users. |

This table provides an overview of Apache Ignite's key features and capabilities.

## Internals

Here is a table summarizing the key internal components and concepts of Apache Ignite:

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Cluster** | A group of nodes working together to store and process data, with each node managing a subset of data and coordinating with others for data sharing and replication. |
| **Data Grid** | The in-memory data storage layer responsible for managing and storing data across the cluster, offering distributed caching, transactions, and SQL queries. |
| **Compute Grid** | The distributed computation layer that enables parallel execution of computations across the cluster, with features such as load balancing, fault tolerance, and job scheduling. |
| **Communication** | A peer-to-peer communication model where nodes interact directly using a custom TCP/IP-based protocol, supporting message fragmentation, batching, and priority-based messaging. |
| **Topology** | The current state of the cluster, including node count, data distribution, and computation task assignments. |
| **Memory Management** | Distributed memory management using on-heap and off-heap memory and memory-mapped files with features for memory eviction, overflow, and compression. |
| **Persistence** | Optional support for persistent storage, allowing data to be stored on disk in addition to memory, using a pluggable storage API and supporting various storage technologies. |
| **Security** | Security features including encryption, authentication, and authorization, implemented via a pluggable security API and supporting technologies like SSL, LDAP, and Kerberos. |
| **Transactions** | Support for distributed transactions with atomic data updates across multiple nodes, using a two-phase commit protocol and features like isolation levels, timeout handling, and recovery. |
| **Monitoring and Management** | Features for monitoring and managing the system, including a web-based management console, a JMX-based API, and integration with third-party monitoring tools such as Grafana and Prometheus. |
