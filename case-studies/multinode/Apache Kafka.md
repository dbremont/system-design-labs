# Apache Kafka

> Apache Kafka is a distributed streaming platform that provides a highly scalable, fault-tolerant, and real-time data processing framework, enabling the reliable and efficient handling of large-scale event streams.
> 

> Apache Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform that provides **high-throughput**, **fault-tolerant**, and **horizontally scalable** publish-subscribe messaging with log-structured storage, leveraging a partitioned, append-only commit log, distributed coordination via Apache ZooKeeper (or KRaft in newer versions), and an efficient binary protocol over TCP for durable, real-time data streaming and processing.
> 

> Kafka's architecture consists of **producers that publish messages** to topics, partitioned across **brokers** for parallelism and fault tolerance, while **consumers** pull messages using a consumer group mechanism that enables load balancing; data is durably stored in segmented, replicated logs across brokers, ensuring high availability and persistence, with ZooKeeper (or KRaft) managing metadata, leader election, and cluster coordination.

## Use Cases

> **Apache Kafka**, a **distributed event streaming platform**, finds applications across various domains due to its scalability, fault tolerance, and real-time data processing capabilities.
> 

> Here’s a table summarizing common **Apache Kafka** use cases:
> 

| **Use Case** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Real-time Data Pipeline** | Kafka acts as a central hub for ingesting and processing real-time data from sources like sensors and logs. |
| **Log Aggregation** | Kafka provides a scalable and fault-tolerant solution for collecting and aggregating log data from distributed systems. |
| **Stream Processing** | Kafka Streams and other frameworks process real-time data streams for tasks like enrichment, filtering, and aggregation. |
| **Event Sourcing** | Kafka's commit log architecture captures application state changes as a sequence of immutable events. |
| **Messaging System** | Kafka replaces traditional message brokers for scalable and fault-tolerant asynchronous communication between services. |
| **Data Integration** | Kafka enables streaming data integration between databases, data lakes, warehouses, and other sources. |
| **Change Data Capture (CDC)** | Kafka captures and streams real-time database changes, allowing immediate reaction and data synchronization. |
| **Metrics Monitoring** | Kafka processes metrics data from various sources for real-time monitoring, alerting, and visualization. |
| **IoT Data Processing** | Kafka handles high volumes of IoT data streams for real-time analytics, anomaly detection, and predictive maintenance. |
| **Fraud Detection** | Kafka processes transactional data streams in real time for fraud detection and prevention. |
| **Clickstream Analysis** | Kafka captures clickstream data to analyze user behavior and optimize user experiences in real time. |
| **Machine Learning Model Deployment** | Kafka streams data to machine learning models for low-latency predictions and continuous updates. |
