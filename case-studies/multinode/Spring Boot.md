## Breviarium

### Spring Ecosystem

> The **Spring Ecosystem** refers to the collection of **open-source Java-based projects** and libraries that extend the functionality of the core Spring Framework to support a wide range of enterprise application development needs.
> 

It encompasses modular and interoperable subprojects such as:

- **Spring Framework** (core container, web, AOP, etc.)
- **Spring Boot** (auto-configuration, embedded servers)
- **Spring Data** (repository abstraction for databases)
- **Spring Security** (authentication, authorization, CSRF protection)
- **Spring Cloud** (distributed systems, configuration, service discovery)
- **Spring Batch**, **Spring Integration**, **Spring Web Services**, etc.

These components adhere to principles such as **dependency injection**, **inversion of control**, and **modular architecture**, and are maintained under the broader Spring umbrella, governed by the Spring team (currently under the VMware Tanzu portfolio).

### Spring Framework

The **Spring Framework** is the foundational open-source application framework in Java, originally released in 2003. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications and serves as the core of the Spring Ecosystem.

Key features include:

- **Core Container**: Dependency injection (DI) and inversion of control (IoC)
- **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**: Cross-cutting concerns like logging and transactions
- **Spring MVC**: A powerful web application framework implementing the Model-View-Controller pattern
- **Data Access/ORM**: Abstractions for JDBC, JPA, and transaction management

It is designed to be **modular**, **non-invasive**, and **extensible**, allowing integration with other Java frameworks and libraries.

### Spring Boot

**Spring Boot** is a convention-over-configuration framework built on top of the Spring Framework. Its primary goal is to enable rapid development of **standalone**, **production-ready** Spring applications with minimal configuration.

Spring Boot introduces:

- **Auto-configuration** based on classpath inspection
- **Opinionated defaults** for project setup
- **Embedded servlet containers** (e.g., Tomcat, Jetty) for self-contained deployment
- **Actuator endpoints** for monitoring and management
- **Starter dependencies** to simplify Maven/Gradle configuration

It preserves full access to the Spring Framework’s capabilities while significantly reducing boilerplate and setup overhead, making it the de facto standard for modern Spring-based development.

## List of Characteristics

> Here's a table summarizing the key characteristics of Spring:
> 

| **Characteristic** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Dependency Injection (DI)** | Allows developers to configure objects and their dependencies at runtime, improving code reusability, testability, and maintainability by decoupling components. |
| **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)** | Supports modularizing cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, and transaction management into reusable components. |
| **Spring MVC** | A Model-View-Controller framework for building web applications, handling HTTP requests and responses, validating user input, and managing application state. |
| **Integration with other frameworks** | Provides integration with frameworks and technologies like Hibernate, JPA, JDBC, JMS, and RESTful web services, facilitating the development of complex applications. |
| **Spring Boot** | A sub-project of Spring that simplifies the setup and configuration of standalone, production-ready applications, offering features like embedded web servers and automatic configuration. |
| **Lightweight and Modular Architecture** | Spring’s design enables the development of complex, enterprise-level Java applications while maintaining flexibility and ease of use. |

## List of Spring Projects

> Here's a table organizing common types of Spring Boot projects and their descriptions:
> 

| **Project Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Spring Boot Web Application** | A project that creates a web application using Spring MVC. It typically serves HTML content or exposes RESTful APIs. |
| **Spring Boot REST API** | A project that builds RESTful web services using Spring MVC, allowing the application to handle HTTP requests and return JSON or XML responses. |
| **Spring Boot Microservices** | A project that develops microservices architecture using Spring Boot, often incorporating Spring Cloud for service discovery, configuration, and resiliency. |
| **Spring Boot Batch Processing** | A project that handles large volumes of data through batch processing, using Spring Batch for job scheduling, processing, and managing workflows. |
| **Spring Boot Data JPA** | A project that integrates with relational databases using Spring Data JPA, providing an abstraction over the database layer for CRUD operations. |
| **Spring Boot Security** | A project that secures applications using Spring Security, providing authentication, authorization, and other security features. |
| **Spring Boot Messaging** | A project that enables message-driven applications using Spring’s support for messaging protocols like JMS, AMQP, or Kafka. |
| **Spring Boot Reactive** | A project that builds non-blocking, reactive applications using Spring WebFlux, supporting asynchronous request handling and backpressure. |
| **Spring Boot OAuth2** | A project that secures APIs and web applications using OAuth2.0 authentication and authorization mechanisms, often integrating with third-party identity providers. |
| **Spring Boot Cloud Config** | A project that externalizes configuration data using Spring Cloud Config, allowing for dynamic updates and centralized management of application properties. |
| **Spring Boot Cloud Gateway** | A project that creates a gateway service for routing and filtering requests to backend services in a microservices architecture using Spring Cloud Gateway. |
| **Spring Boot AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming)** | A project that implements cross-cutting concerns like logging, security, or transaction management using Spring AOP, without modifying the application logic directly. |
| **Spring Boot Integration** | A project that integrates various enterprise services using Spring Integration, enabling message routing, transformation, and orchestration. |
| **Spring Boot Actuator** | A project that adds monitoring and management capabilities to Spring Boot applications, providing metrics, health checks, and endpoint management. |
| **Spring Boot Testing** | A project that includes automated testing capabilities for Spring Boot applications, using tools like JUnit, Mockito, and Spring’s testing support. |
