# Metaculus

> Metaculus is an online forecasting platform that leverages collective intelligence by aggregating predictions from a diverse community to generate accurate forecasts on science, technology, geopolitics, and other complex questions.

> **Metaculus** is a collaborative forecasting platform focused on science, technology, policy, and global risks. It aggregates individual probability forecasts to produce a consensus prediction and a community distribution. Itâ€™s designed to harness collective intelligence, not financial incentives. Metaculus is not a prediction market in the traditional financial sense. It resembles a scoring-based collective cognition system, not a financial market-based system.

> A **prediction market** involves buying and selling securities or contracts tied to the outcome of future events. Prices reflect collective beliefs about the probability of those events. Examples: Kalshi, PredictIt, Manifold Markets (play-money), Augur (crypto).
