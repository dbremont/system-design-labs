## Standard Commands

**OpenSSL** provides a set of standard commands that you can use from the command-line interface to perform various cryptographic operations and interact with certificates and keys. Here is a list of some of the most commonly used standard commands provided by OpenSSL:

- `openssl version`: Display the OpenSSL version information.
- `openssl help`: Show a list of OpenSSL commands and their brief descriptions.
- `openssl genrsa`: Generate an RSA private key.
- `openssl rsa`: Perform RSA algorithm operations on private keys, such as key generation, encryption, and decryption.
- `openssl req`: Create a certificate signing request (CSR) to obtain a digital certificate from a certificate authority (CA).
- `openssl x509`: Perform operations on X.509 certificates, such as displaying certificate information, signing certificates, and verifying certificate chains.
- `openssl pkcs12`: Create or manipulate PKCS#12 files, which can store private keys, certificates, and CA chains in a single encrypted file.
- `openssl s_client`: Initiate an SSL/TLS connection to a remote server and print the certificate information.
- `openssl s_server`: Create a simple SSL/TLS server for testing purposes.
- `openssl enc`: Encrypt or decrypt data using various symmetric encryption algorithms.
- `openssl dgst`: Compute hash values (digests) of data using various hash algorithms.
- `openssl base64`: Encode or decode data in Base64 format.
- `openssl rand`: Generate random data.
- `openssl speed`: Measure the speed of cryptographic algorithms.
- `openssl cms`: Create and process CMS (Cryptographic Message Syntax) messages.
- `openssl ts`: Query and manage timestamping authorities to timestamp digital signatures.

These are just some of the many commands provided by OpenSSL. Each command has various options and arguments to customize its behavior and fulfill different cryptographic tasks. For more detailed information about each command and its usage, you can use the `openssl help` command followed by the specific command you want to learn more about (e.g., `openssl help genrsa`).

## Message Digest commands (Cryptographic Hash Functions)

Sure, here is a list of OpenSSL commands for generating message digests:

- `openssl dgst`: Compute message digests (hashes) for files or input data.
- `openssl md4`: Compute the MD4 message digest.
- `openssl md5`: Compute the MD5 message digest.
- `openssl sha1`: Compute the SHA-1 message digest.
- `openssl sha224`: Compute the SHA-224 message digest.
- `openssl sha256`: Compute the SHA-256 message digest.
- `openssl sha384`: Compute the SHA-384 message digest.
- `openssl sha512`: Compute the SHA-512 message digest.
- `openssl sha3-224`: Compute the SHA-3-224 message digest.
- `openssl sha3-256`: Compute the SHA-3-256 message digest.
- `openssl sha3-384`: Compute the SHA-3-384 message digest.
- `openssl sha3-512`: Compute the SHA-3-512 message digest.
- `openssl whirlpool`: Compute the Whirlpool message digest.

These commands allow you to calculate message digests using different cryptographic hash functions provided by OpenSSL. Each command is followed by options and arguments to specify the input data, output format, and other configurations.

Keep in mind that older hash functions like MD4, MD5, and SHA-1 are no longer considered secure for cryptographic purposes, and it is recommended to use stronger hash functions like SHA-256 or SHA-3 for security-critical applications.

## Cipher Commands

OpenSSL provides various cipher commands for symmetric encryption and decryption using different algorithms and key lengths. Here is a list of some commonly used OpenSSL cipher commands:

- **aes-128-cbc**: Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with a key length of 128 bits in Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode.
- **aes-192-cbc**: AES with a key length of 192 bits in CBC mode.
- **aes-256-cbc**: AES with a key length of 256 bits in CBC mode.
- **des-cbc**: Data Encryption Standard (DES) in CBC mode.
- **des-ede3-cbc**: Triple DES (3DES) in CBC mode.
- **bf-cbc**: Blowfish cipher in CBC mode.
- **camellia-128-cbc**: Camellia cipher with a key length of 128 bits in CBC mode.
- **camellia-192-cbc**: Camellia cipher with a key length of 192 bits in CBC mode.
- **camellia-256-cbc**: Camellia cipher with a key length of 256 bits in CBC mode.
- **rc4**: RC4 stream cipher.

These are just a few examples of the available cipher commands in OpenSSL. OpenSSL supports a wide range of cryptographic algorithms and modes, allowing users to choose the most appropriate one for their specific encryption needs.

When using OpenSSL’s cipher commands, it’s important to note that some algorithms, like RC4 and DES, are no longer considered secure and should be avoided for new applications. Instead, it is recommended to use AES with at least a 128-bit key length for secure symmetric encryption. Additionally, for more secure encryption modes, consider using authenticated encryption schemes like AES-GCM or AES-CCM, which provide both confidentiality and data integrity. Always keep your OpenSSL library up to date to benefit from the latest security improvements and patches.
