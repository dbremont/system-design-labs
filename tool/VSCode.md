    - How the **`LSP`** research and resolve symbols from `external libraries`?

## List of Components

| **Component** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Electron Framework** | VS Code is built on the Electron framework, combining Chromium for rendering and Node.js for backend functionality, enabling cross-platform desktop applications. |
| **Architecture** | VS Code follows a modular architecture with a primary process for managing the UI and multiple sandboxed renderer processes for displaying different UI parts. |
| **Extensions** | VS Code's extensibility allows developers to add new features, languages, themes, and integrations by writing extensions in JavaScript and interacting with the VS Code API. |
| **Language Services** | Language services in VS Code are provided through the Language Server Protocol (LSP), offering consistent language support with features like autocompletion and linting. |
| **Source Control Integration** | Built-in Git integration in VS Code enables developers to manage version control directly from the editor, with a graphical interface for everyday Git operations. |
| **Workspace and Settings** | VS Code allows the management of workspace settings stored in a `.code-workspace` file, which can override user settings for specific projects. |
| **User Interface** | The UI of VS Code is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using the Monaco Editor for code editing, and is highly customizable in terms of themes, layout, and more. |
| **Extension Host and APIs** | The Extension Host, a separate Node.js process, loads and manages extensions and provides APIs for interacting with the editor, including UI modification and code analysis. |
| **Keybinding System** | A flexible keybinding system in VS Code allows users to customize keyboard shortcuts through the `keybindings.json` configuration file. |
| **Debugging** | VS Code offers a rich debugging experience, supporting breakpoints, step-throughs, variable inspection, and more across various programming languages. |
| **Remote Development** | VS Code supports remote development, enabling work on projects hosted on remote machines or containers and enhancing workflows for complex setups. |

### How the **`LSP`** research and resolve symbols from `external libraries`?

> The method varies by programming language; this table serves as a reference, so please use it carefully.
> 

| **Language** | **LSP Server / Tool** | **External Library Symbol Resolution Method** | **Notes** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **C / C++** | clangd | Uses `compile_commands.json` (compilation database) to find full compile flags, include paths, and external headers. | Preferred method for projects with build system support; provides precise symbol info. |
|  |  | Uses `c_cpp_properties.json` to manually specify include paths, macros, and compiler flags for symbol resolution in external libs.  | Useful for manual configuration or simple projects without compilation database. |
| **Rust** | rust-analyzer | Uses Cargo metadata (`Cargo.toml`, `Cargo.lock`) to fetch, cache, and index external crates and symbols. | Fully integrated with Cargo package manager. |
| **Go** | gopls | Uses Go modules (`go.mod`) to download, cache, and index external dependencies and symbols. | Relies on Go tooling for module management. |
| **Python** | pyright, pylance | Uses virtual environment or system interpreter site-packages to index installed libraries and symbols. | Static analysis within interpreter environment. |
| **Java** | Eclipse JDT Language Server | Uses build tool classpaths (Maven, Gradle) to locate external jars, then indexes class files and metadata for symbols. | Build tool driven classpath resolution. |
| **JavaScript / TypeScript** | tsserver (TypeScript Server) | Uses `node_modules` folder and `package.json` to resolve and index external packages and type declarations (`@types`). | Node module resolution and typings. |
| **C#** | OmniSharp | Uses MSBuild project/solution files to resolve NuGet packages and referenced assemblies for symbol info. | NuGet packages referenced via MSBuild metadata. |
| **Ruby** | solargraph | Uses Gemfile and installed gems to index external symbols from gems. | Reads Gemfile.lock and local gem installations. |
| **PHP** | Intelephense | Uses Composer autoload files and vendor directory to find and index external packages. | Composer-driven dependency management. |
| **Swift** | SourceKit-LSP | Uses Swift Package Manager (SwiftPM) and system frameworks to resolve and index external symbols. | Integrates with SwiftPM dependency info. |
| **Kotlin** | Kotlin Language Server | Uses Gradle or Maven build information to resolve dependencies and index external symbols. | Build tool driven dependency resolution. |

### How **`IntelliSense Engine`** research and resolve symbols from `external libraries`?

| Step / Mechanism | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Include Path Configuration** | IntelliSense uses configured include paths (from `c_cpp_properties.json` or detected from build) to locate header files of external libraries. Without correct include paths, it can’t find declarations. |
| **Macros and Defines** | It processes preprocessor macros and defines (also from config or build info) to parse conditional code correctly in external headers. |
| **Parsing Headers (Static Analysis)** | IntelliSense performs static parsing of the headers found via include paths to understand types, functions, classes, constants, and macros exposed by external libraries. |
| **Indexing and Caching** | After parsing, IntelliSense indexes symbols for quick lookup and caches parsed information to speed up subsequent queries. |
| **Compile Commands / Build Info** | If a `compile_commands.json` or similar compilation database is provided, IntelliSense uses the exact compiler flags, include paths, and defines used during build, improving accuracy for external library resolution. |
| **Fallback to Manual Configuration** | If no compilation database is found, IntelliSense falls back to `c_cpp_properties.json` for manual config of include paths, defines, and compiler flags. |
